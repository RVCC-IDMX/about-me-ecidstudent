# About Me


Echo Idenden! (she/her)

Hello, as stated above, my name is Echo. I am a trans woman, and I go by she/her. I've joined Raritan Valley's web design course because I wanted to learn how to make websites, as I use the internet quite a lot, and so far I can say I've learned a good bit.

The purpose of my personal about me was to introduce myself, and show what I've learned, and how I know to put it to use. I used colors I enjoy, showed off my main hobbies, shared a video of my cat, and just gave an overall sort of quick glimpse into my life as it is currently. I think what I've done here for my "About Me" page does a good job of showing who I am as a person as well as what I've learned from this class, and the teachers that run it.

The colors I used are simple, a soft shade of pink I'm very fond of (#EBA0E6), and a sort of teal or green that I think complimented it really well (#649E97). Pink in particular is a color I enjoy, and while I like palettes involving pink and blue, I realized this color combo looked a good bit nicer.
